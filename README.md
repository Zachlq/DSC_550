# DSC_550

This folder contains a summation of my work in DSC 550: Data Mining. The course focused on the conception, translation and implementation of associative mining algorithms in a practical business-driven context. Some of the  algorithms examined in the course and featured in this folder include DENCLUE, CHARM and Gradient Descent. 

# Final Project

The final project folder contains the files associated with my project: And Now, the Fake News, a classification project to distinguish information from disinformation. Using recent data (less than four years old), the project utilized natural language processing techniques (NLP) to train a model to make a binary decision of true or untrue. The model was then assessed with various classification algorithm pipelines including Support Vector Machine, linear regression, Naive Bayes and KNN. Naive Bayes displayed the weakest precision and accuracy rates while the support vector machine methodology yielded the highest accuracy rate of nearly 97%.
