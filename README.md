Pt. 1 Charm - 

For the Charm algorithm, please review the Charm_Sample file as well as the Charm_Mushroom. 
I was able to group item sets using a smaller sample file, but not able to do so using the mushroom.txt file due to a key error. 

Pt 2. Derivable item sets.

Due to my confusion with Charm, pt. 2 is not entirely complete. However, I included extensive comments detailing pseduo code and logic
for how I would approach creating an algorithm to handle this problem. 

Pt 3. 

I was able to compute all metrics except for diagonals and nearest neighbors. 

Pt. 4

The problem set from the Mining of Massive Data Sets textbook.
